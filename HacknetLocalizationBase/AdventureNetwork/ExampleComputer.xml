  <!-- 
  Security is a number from 0 to 5 that represents how hard it is to hack
  From 1-4 it will need that many ports to open, 4 and above will automatically
  add other security to scale it up easily, you can overwrite specifics below
  AllowsDefaultBootModule is default to true and means that when you connect to a node
  it will automatically launch it's program (the last daemon defined in this file) and
  put it up on the display module.
  Because this example computer shows off a lot of stuff, I've set this to false here.
